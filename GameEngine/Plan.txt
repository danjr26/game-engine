--Plot--
The main conflict is between the Terrans of Earth and the Khivaru of Ourus V. The game takes place in 2488 CE, the time of the first skirmishes between the two races.

The Terrans have known about the Khivaru for decades, though it is only in the past few years that this information has been released to the general populus. They are a race of approximately equal technological advancement to the Terrans - the most advanced species that the Terrans have so far encountered. The Khivaru, however, are ruthless in their dealings with less advanced species. Caring little for comfort goods, their entire economy is based on empire building. Hundreds of other planets have fallen to their might, swelling their numbers well into the trillions.
