weapons can be sold for money
weapons can be repaired w/ consumable 'boost kit', which is less effective when used on same weapon
use 1 - +2 levels
use 2 - +1 level
use 3+ - maintain current level

dodge - speed burst, invincible for very short period; recharges ~2s
store
	damage
	recharge

slowdown - slows world down (including player); lasts for period of time which can be pushed further for mission-long decrease in efficacy
store
	increase world slowdown
	decrease player slowdown
	increase safe capacity
	increase unsafe capacity

rusher - rushes at player; stops and moves erratically backwards if player is looking at it within donut; inside donut "activates" and kamikazies

runner - makes runs at player, shooting when moving towards

tank - frequent burst shots, occasional missile, slowly moves towards player



shields take heavy damage, but when break, temporarily disable ships in immediate area
